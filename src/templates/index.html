    <p>Welcome to Word Ladders! This is a game where you go from one word to another by swapping/deleting/inserting one letter at a time.</p>
  
    <p> Click PLAY THE GAME! to have the computer generate two words for you, which you can solve as a puzzle.</p>
    <p> Click WORD LADDER SOLVER, to find the shortest path between two words which you can specify!</p>

    <p> The words can be of lengths ranging from THREE to SEVEN letters. The intermediate words must be valid. The aim is to find the shortest path of words.</p>
